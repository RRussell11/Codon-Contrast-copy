# Codon-Contrast-copy
Codon-Contrast SARS2 Work: A Python project for processing and analyzing SARS2-related data, providing a template for loading, processing, and testing datasets within the Codon-Contrast workflow
# Codon-Contrast SARS2 Work

## Overview
This repository contains the `sars2_temp.py` script, a work-in-progress Python module designed to support SARS2-related data processing and analysis within the Codon-Contrast project. The current version serves as a foundational template for data handling, processing, and testing workflows.

---

## Current Functionality
- **Data Loading:**  
  The script currently includes a placeholder `load_data()` function that simulates loading SARS2 data. This can be extended to read from CSV, JSON, or external sources.  

- **Data Processing:**  
  The `process_data()` function demonstrates simple processing logic (e.g., doubling numeric values). This structure can be adapted for more complex SARS2 analyses.

- **Execution:**  
  Running the script executes a `main()` function that loads, processes, and prints results.

- **Example Output:**

**TESTS
The project includes 4 implemented tests to validate SARS2 data processing functionality. These tests cover data loading, processing, and workflow correctness, ensuring that changes to sars2_temp.py maintain expected outputs within the Multiplicity Quantum framework
